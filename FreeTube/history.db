If you&apos;ve rejected other units libraries because they couldn&apos;t meet your needs, check out Au (pronounced, &quot;ay yoo&quot;).  It combines cutting-edge developer experience (fast compilation, simple and readable compiler errors) with wide accessibility (C++14 compatibility, single-header delivery option).  You can be up and running with Au in your project -- in any build system -- in less time than it takes to read this abstract!\n\nWe&apos;ll orient the viewer by providing a decision framework for choosing a units library, and using this framework to compare several leading options. We&apos;ll also see how these libraries influence each other. For example, Au has several compelling features inspired by other libraries, such as the concise and readable compiler errors of mp-units, and the frictionless single-header delivery of the nholthaus library --- in fact, Au is the first library to provide both these features at once. Au has also provided many new features of its own, including: fully unit-safe APIs; an adaptive &quot;overflow safety surface&quot; that governs unit conversions; on-the-fly composition for units and prefixes; smart, unit-aware rounding and inverse functions; and more.\n\nFinally, Au has a notably low barrier to migration --- in either direction.  We&apos;ll explain how to set up a correspondence between Au and any other units library.  Even though neither library knows about the other, you&apos;ll be able to pass Au-typed variables to APIs which take the other library&apos;s types, and vice versa.  This doesn&apos;t just make it easy to switch to Au; it promises a smooth upgrade path to any better library which comes along later (such as a future C++ standard units library).  With such a low barrier to entry, give Au a try, and find out what it feels like to get effortlessly correct handling for all your physical quantities!\n---\n\nChip Hogg\n\nChip Hogg is a Staff Software Engineer on the Motion Planning Team at Aurora Innovation, the self-driving vehicle company that is developing the Aurora Driver. After obtaining his PhD in Physics from Carnegie Mellon in 2010, he was a postdoctoral researcher and then staff scientist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), doing Bayesian data analysis. He joined Google in 2012 as a software engineer, leaving in 2016 to work on autonomous vehicles at Uber&apos;s Advanced Technologies Group, where he stayed until their acquisition by Aurora in 2021.\n\nChip&apos;s main role at Aurora is to design libraries that make it as easy as possible to write integration tests for Aurora&apos;s motion planner. He is also the lead author and maintainer of Aurora&apos;s units library, Au, and led its open-source release in 2023.\n---\n\nVideos Filmed &amp; Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com/\nYouTube Channel Managed by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk/\n---\n\nRegistration for CppCon: https://cppcon.org/registration/\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/cppcon\">#cppcon</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/cppprogramming\">#cppprogramming</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/cpp\">#cpp</a>","viewCount":4030,"lengthSeconds":3850,"watchProgress":6.525554,"timeWatched":1704134326293,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"XSbBEy75XysA64k1"}

They increase productivity, significantly reduce bugs, and improve maintainability. This talk explains why and how algorithms do this. Additionally, it demonstrates why they are an amazing example for good, extensible software design.\n---\n\nKlaus Iglberger\n\nKlaus Iglberger is a freelance C++ trainer and consultant. He has finished his PhD in Computer Science in 2010 and since then is focused on large-scale C++ software design. He shares his expertise in popular advanced C++ courses around the world (mainly in Germany, but also in the rest of the EU and the US). Additionally, he is the author of “C++ Software Design”, the initiator and lead designer of the Blaze C++ math library, one of the organizers of the Munich C++ user group, and the (co-)organizer of the Back-to-Basics and Software Design tracks at CppCon.\n---\n\nVideos Filmed &amp; Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com/\nYouTube Channel Managed by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk/\n---\n\nRegistration for CppCon: https://cppcon.org/registration/\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/cppcon\">#cppcon</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/cppprogramming\">#cppprogramming</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/cpp\">#cpp</a>","viewCount":12091,"lengthSeconds":3595,"watchProgress":872.730949,"timeWatched":1704134375803,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"fKhEgOOrGuLnaD8z"}
