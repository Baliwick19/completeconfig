The VHP claim the mosque was built at the birthsite of the Hindu god Ram after Babar razed an existing Ram temple. They are determined to build a new temple to Ram on the same site. This controversial issue which successive governments have refused to resolve has led to religious riots which have cost thousands their lives, culminating in the mosque’s destruction by the Hindus in December of 1992.\n\nFilmed prior to the mosque’s demolition, IN THE NAME OF GOD examines the motivations which would ultimately lead to the drastic actions of the Hindu militants, as well as the efforts of secular Indians of all creeds to combat the religious intolerance and hatred that seized India in the name of God.","viewCount":2244954,"lengthSeconds":4517,"watchProgress":756.30273,"timeWatched":1705509070281,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"S8Tnlb5VyBJ2Blat"}

{"videoId":"o0ck5eqpOLc","title":"The Au C++ Units Library: Handling Physical Units Safely, Quickly, & Broadly - Chip Hogg - CppCon 23","author":"CppCon","authorId":"UCMlGfpWw-RUdWX_JbLCukXg","published":1704036552000,"description":"https://cppcon.org/\n---\n\nThe Au C++ Units Library: Handling Physical Units Safely, Quickly, and Broadly - Chip Hogg - CppCon 2023\nhttps://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2023\n\nWe present Au: a new open-source C++ units library, by Aurora.  If you&apos;ve rejected other units libraries because they couldn&apos;t meet your needs, check out Au (pronounced, &quot;ay yoo&quot;).  It combines cutting-edge developer experience (fast compilation, simple and readable compiler errors) with wide accessibility (C++14 compatibility, single-header delivery option).  You can be up and running with Au in your project -- in any build system -- in less time than it takes to read this abstract!\n\nWe&apos;ll orient the viewer by providing a decision framework for choosing a units library, and using this framework to compare several leading options. We&apos;ll also see how these libraries influence each other. For example, Au has several compelling features inspired by other libraries, such as the concise and readable compiler errors of mp-units, and the frictionless single-header delivery of the nholthaus library --- in fact, Au is the first library to provide both these features at once. Au has also provided many new features of its own, including: fully unit-safe APIs; an adaptive &quot;overflow safety surface&quot; that governs unit conversions; on-the-fly composition for units and prefixes; smart, unit-aware rounding and inverse functions; and more.\n\nFinally, Au has a notably low barrier to migration --- in either direction.  We&apos;ll explain how to set up a correspondence between Au and any other units library.  Even though neither library knows about the other, you&apos;ll be able to pass Au-typed variables to APIs which take the other library&apos;s types, and vice versa.  This doesn&apos;t just make it easy to switch to Au; it promises a smooth upgrade path to any better library which comes along later (such as a future C++ standard units library).  With such a low barrier to entry, give Au a try, and find out what it feels like to get effortlessly correct handling for all your physical quantities!\n---\n\nChip Hogg\n\nChip Hogg is a Staff Software Engineer on the Motion Planning Team at Aurora Innovation, the self-driving vehicle company that is developing the Aurora Driver. After obtaining his PhD in Physics from Carnegie Mellon in 2010, he was a postdoctoral researcher and then staff scientist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), doing Bayesian data analysis. He joined Google in 2012 as a software engineer, leaving in 2016 to work on autonomous vehicles at Uber&apos;s Advanced Technologies Group, where he stayed until their acquisition by Aurora in 2021.\n\nChip&apos;s main role at Aurora is to design libraries that make it as easy as possible to write integration tests for Aurora&apos;s motion planner. He is also the lead author and maintainer of Aurora&apos;s units library, Au, and led its open-source release in 2023.\n---\n\nVideos Filmed &amp; Edited by Bash Films: http://www.BashFilms.com/\nYouTube Channel Managed by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk/\n---\n\nRegistration for CppCon: https://cppcon.org/registration/\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/cppcon\">#cppcon</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/cppprogramming\">#cppprogramming</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/cpp\">#cpp</a>","viewCount":4030,"lengthSeconds":3850,"watchProgress":6.525554,"timeWatched":1704134326293,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"XSbBEy75XysA64k1"}

We will install and enable virtualization.\n\nKVM stands for Kernel-based Virtual Machine. This software allows users to run multiple virtual machines with different operating systems. KVM is open-source, and has been refined and improved over the last ten years. \nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/KVM\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/QEMU\n\nWe will also install a program called virt-manager to add and update your virtual machines with a graphical user interface. \nhttps://virt-manager.org/\n\nIn KVM you can install nearly all operating systems. All linux distributions are supported and of course also Windows 11. I use Windows 11 and Office 365 installed in a virtual machine for my work. And it works extremly stable, fast and it&apos;s easy to maintain. \n\nYou can find the KVM installation script here:\nhttps://gitlab.com/stephan-raabe/archinstall/-/blob/main/7-kvm.sh\n\nA note to viewers using Ubuntu: Please search on Google for an installation tutorial. There are many well documented options available. \n\nLearn how you can use Linux for your work. \nLinux is a great Operating System (OS) to support me daily at my business.

(in 2 minutes)","author":"Visually Explained","authorId":"UCoTo2gtN527CXhe7jbP6hUg","published":1636720206000,"description":"Overview of Linear Programming in 2 minutes.\n\n----------------------\nAdditional Information on the distinction between &quot;Polynomial&quot; vs &quot;Strongly Polynomial&quot; algorithms:\nAn algorithm for solving LPs of the form \nmax c^t x s.t. Ax \\le b\nruns in polynomial time if its running time can be bounded by a polynomial D^r, where &quot;r&quot; is some integer, and D is the bit-size of the data of the problem, or in other words, D is the amount of memory that it takes to store the matrix A and the vectors b and c. On the other hand, an algorithm runs in strongly polynomial time if its running time can be bounded by a polynomial n^r m^s, where &quot;r&quot; and &quot;s&quot; are integers, &quot;n&quot; is the number of variables and &quot;m&quot; is the number of constraints. \n\nThe distinction is subtle, but is an important one. Essentially, a polynomial time algorithm is allowed to take more time as the size of the coefficients of A grows (while keeping the dimensions of A constant), but a strongly polynomial time algorithm is not.\n\n(I glossed over some details here. For example in the definition of strong polynomial time algorithms, we assume that the basic arithmetic operations take a constant time no matter the size of the operands.)\n\nThe interior point method is a polynomial time algorithm, but not a strongly polynomial time one (e.g., https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01544).\n\n----------------------\nTypos:\n- &quot;Schedueling&quot; should be &quot;Scheduling&quot;\n\n--------------\n\nTimestamps:\n- 0:00 Motivating Example\n- 0:39 Definition\n- 1:07 Applications\n- 1:42 Code\n- 2:00 Open Problems\n\n\n---------------\nCredit:\n🐍 Manim and Python : https://github.com/3b1b/manim\n🐵 Blender3D: https://www.blender.org/\n🗒️ Emacs: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/\nMusic/Sound: www.bensound.com, Zapsplat.com\n\nThis video would not have been possible without the help of Gökçe Dayanıklı.","viewCount":12442,"lengthSeconds":157,"watchProgress":148.767524,"timeWatched":1704286586849,"isLive":false,"type":"video","_id":"tT7SXHw59c32AMrm"}
